						"Background: The mining industry is known worldwide for its highly risky and hazardous working environment. Technological advancement in extraction techniques for proliferation of production levels has caused further concern for safety in this industry. Research so far in the area of safety has revealed that the majority of incidents in this hazardous industry take place because of human error, the control of which would enhance safety levels in working sites to a considerable extent. India is the world's second-largest coal producer as of 2021. Coal production in the country stood at 715.95 million tons (MT) in FY21. Between April 2021 and October 2021, coal production in India stood at 379.597 million tons (MT). Coal is the main pillar of India’s energy sector. In 2021, it said, India consumed 93.2 crore tons of coal, 77% of which came from domestic production and 90% of which was used for power generation. The National Foundation of India study said that crores of Indians depend on the coal economy directly or indirectly. It highlighted that more than 1.3 crore Indians are employed in coal mining, transport, power, sponge iron, steel and bricks sectors. Mining workers are affected by many hazards – from ventilation problems, mine flooding, gas explosions, ceiling collapsing, mine haulage, sudden inrushes and mine inundation, spontaneous combustion, to un-optimized evacuation routes. There is no exact solution that can forecast these risks and avoid them even before they occur. Summary: Mining workers are affected by many hazards – from ventilation problems, mine flooding, gas explosions, ceiling collapsing, mine haulage, sudden inrushes and mine inundation, spontaneous combustion, to un-optimized evacuation routes. And mine operators have been working for decades to ensure no fatal accident results in death, injury, or poor health of miners. Objective: To give a solution to design smart work clothing that has sensors embedded in it to securely transmit data to managers about hazardous conditions and the workers’ physical conditions, improving safety overall."

						“Switch off” Biometric Attendance on March 5th, 2020 Delhi government announced the suspension of biometric attendance in its offices via a letter written to principal secretaries, secretaries, autonomous bodies, and municipal corporations for the suspension of biometric attendance to contain the spread of coronavirus. However, it was on Feb 17th, 2020 when Maharishi Valmiki Hospital in the Capital City of India suspended biometric attendance announcing it as a “precautionary measure” after many of its employees complained to the authorities that touching the biometric system is “psychological unease” on account of coronavirus scare. The need for the system is an untouchable device. And also students can't cheat with the system. Devise a secure way to take attendance of students and teachers in a touchless and paperless manner in order to have a sustainable way. This project aims to provide a touchless and paperless attendance system

												"As the adoption of online education has grown in India., reaching millions of high school and college students yearly, educators and textbook manufacturers have sought ways to move labs to the online environment. Digital labs and simulations have been developed in many scientific disciplines, from physics to biology, from chemistry to earth sciences, and are sometimes intended to replace labs and other times intended to supplement face-to-face instruction. Collections of these digital labs and simulations can be found at many sites. Various groups have published evidence that virtual labs and simulations can be effective tools for promoting student learning (e.g., Millis et al., 2011; Baker and Verran, 2004; Sommers and Sommers, 2003; Martinez-Jimenez et al., 2003). As a group of experienced lab instructors with expertise in various disciplines (astronomy, biology, chemistry, earth sciences, and physics), we sought to review digital labs and/or simulations to determine the best use of these tools in our teaching as well as to determine the characteristics that made a digital lab a useful teaching tool.Devise a way to impart knowledge in children about practical subjects like Chemistry, Physics, and Biology.This project aims to create a platform using various technologies like AR/VR, Deep learning in order to give cheap and efficient solutions to schools to teach practical subjects"

														It is required to develop a smart attendance capturing mobile app with following features: 1. It should capture basic details of employees like Photograph (headshot), Name, Designation, Employee Number, Gender, Office Address, etc. 2. It should recognize the employee by face while capturing the attendance (entry) through face recognition and enter the relevant details including entry time in the system after successful face recognition. Similarly, while exiting the office premises, employee will be recognized using his/her face and exit time will be entered in the system. 3. The app should automatically capture the GPS location where the attendance is being taken and allow capturing the attendance only in a geo-fenced area (100 meters within LATITUDE/LONGITUDE) the office premises. Otherwise, the app should automatically exit. 4. The app should successfully work for any specific employees with or without wearing spectacles, cap or industrial helmet. The mobile app needs be developed on Android platform. The team members can be taken as employees and college/hackathon premises will be taken as office address for the purpose of demonstration. The mobile app must use deep learning powered computer vision for face recognition and the accuracy must be above 95%. Further, during the actual hackathon, a randomly chosen person will be entered as a new employee in the app and it should successfully capture the attendance (entry and exit) of that new employee for the purpose of demonstration of successful working of the app in order for GAIL to accept the solution.

																				"Background: Mining operations are generally spread over a vast area in remote locations and harsh environments. Coal extraction is a high cost and increasingly high technology venture that requires the utmost operational efficiency as well as uninterrupted workflow and delivery cycles. Operations cannot afford to be impacted due to lack of visibility as to the location and status of machinery, equipment and vehicles, since this causes delays, increased cost and mounting losses and is also an open invitation to theft and misuse. Real-time location tracking and monitoring, especially of moveable assets such as the vehicle fleet transporting the coal, is thus of critical importance to the mining industry. Tracking pickups and deliveries of thousands of truck-loads moving daily to and from various locations inside mining areas to processing plants, rail wagons or jetties is a logistics nightmare. Moving vehicle registration plate detection: RFID is fitted with vehicles moving across the mining region. The RFIDs are mapped to their respective registration number. It happens that two vehicles may exchange registration plates for malicious purpose including theft or forgery. A system is to be created to extract registration number from number plate of moving vehicle. The data captured should be transferred to cloud environment which can be available for further analysis of theft or proof reading. Summary: In general, most companies employ an active (battery-powered) radio frequency identification system to track trucks entering and leaving a mine with a load. This can be accomplished via a real-time location system (RTLS) if there are vehicles parked that need to be located quickly. But more commonly, an active RFID transponder is affixed to a vehicle, with readers set up at various points—at a mine’s entry gate, at a weigh station, at an exit and so forth. Software tracks the truck’s location, and you can usually run a variety of reports. The best solution really depends on the type of information that you would like to collect and use. Objective: To create an anti-theft auto security system that can extract registration number from number plate of moving vehicle. And can capture and transfer data to cloud, which can be available for further analysis of theft or proof reading."

In the early part of the century, innovators in Hungary, the Netherlands and the United States -- including a blacksmith from Vermont -- began toying with the concept of a battery-powered vehicle and created some of the first small-scale electric cars. And while Robert Anderson, a British inventor, developed the first crude electric carriage around this same time, it wasn’t until the second half of the 19th century that French and English inventors built some of the first practical electric cars. Here in the U.S., the first successful electric car made its debut around 1890 thanks to William Morrison, a chemist who lived in Des Moines, Iowa. His six-passenger vehicle capable of a top speed of 14 miles per hour was little more than an electrified wagon, but it helped spark interest in electric vehicles.Under the EV rollout plan the power ministry is targeting 4 billion plus population cities under the EV policy initiative. The success of EV adoption hinges upon successful deployment of EV charging infrastructure. Location analysis for EV charging stations helps optimize utilisation and maximize benefits that include the number of EVs in the area and grid infrastructure. The core of the problem is demand and supply.The objective is to develop a sharing charging model to solve the location problem for EV charging stations.

																					During Covid – 19 crisis, many private hospitals had charged huge and unimaginable amounts from patients and made enormous profits taking advantage of panic conditions. Notwithstanding of spending huge amounts many families lost their members and in some instances hospitals even demanded clearance of pending bills for handing over bodies to their families. There was no proper information about availability of beds and details of treatment provided etc. In order to curb this exploitation by private hospitals, there is a requirement of national information portal which can regulate all the private hospitals and provide accurate details of rates and medical facilities available in the private hospitals across the country to guide the citizens to get affordable medical emergency services as per their choice and availability.

																						Background: Passwords are ubiquitous today on any platform, on possibly any website. But to remember so difficult passwords and that too on numerous websites seems daunting and therefore you can devise a project illustrating graphical password strategy. This will allow the user to set passwords in the form of graphical presentation in a certain pattern and later use that pattern to login o the system. Summary: Remembering numerous passwords from various different sites can be difficult for a user. So to provide some flexibility we can provide users a graphical password authentication system where instead of creating a password a user has to select graphical objects in a particular order to keep it as their password. Objective: : In this method, the user is required to select some images (let’s say different chocolates) in a specific pattern (for example dairy milk is followed by 5 stars which is in turn followed by KitKat and so on). Next time the user tries to log in, the images would have been shuffled, but the user will be required to follow the same pattern which was used initially. Every time the user will have to use the same sequence while the images are placed in different ways. This type of authentication is difficult to break since neither brute force nor dictionary attacks could breach it. We need techniques that can be easily implemented and provide better results to this process.

																							Background: The world’s natural resources are already depleting, and people are starting to feel the repercussions of a wasteful lifestyle. As such, energy conservation is vital in today’s world. Not only does it help households save money, but it also encourages consumers to be more conscious about preserving natural resources. IoT has made homes smarter, so its application in energy conservation is more accessible. Smart appliances can inform homeowners of real-time consumption so that they can monitor their energy usage. Reports can easily be generated or extracted, allowing homeowners to monitor their daily, weekly, and monthly energy consumption accurately. In addition, sensors can be installed so that when owners leave the house, appliances will automatically turn off to conserve energy. Summary: In order to conserve energy we need to keep a check on all the type of resources that are being used in our day to day life. With IoT it becomes easy to track the resources we are using and we can monitor and keep a check on. Reports generated from such monitoring system can help in conserving natural resources and reduce unnecessary wastage if any. Objective: : We would like you to develop a mobile/web app system using IoT to make energy conservation easy. Also provide reports on usage of all the resources in day to day life and smart automation methods to reduce the amounts of any resource we use.

																									Currently in schools teachers perform manual work to prepare and track students learning’s outcome through report cards. This is the standard procedure done manually throughout the country. Often it is observed that students are also good in co-curricular activities and being good in academics is not the only way ahead. In current situation it is not possible for a teacher to pay attention to every student and find out the best in a child. Hence there is a need to develop solutions to track all activities of a student including the academic progress in real-time. Innovation in this domain will be appreciated to develop systems which automatically reads the students progress and generates feedback also is a good way to proceed.

																										"Problem/Current Situation: INCOIS is providing Marine Fishery Advisory Services to the fishermen. To evaluate it’s accuracy and in order to develop species-specific advisories it is necessary to collect the fish-catch information at the species level. While fisherfolk are supportive to these efforts, often species level catch reporting is having hinderances due to several reasons pertaining to manual efforts which results to low or erroneous reporting. Solution Needed: Hackathon teams may develop AI-ML based tool for image-based identification of fish-species found in the Indian seas. The images of fishes may be taken from online image searches. Similar tools are provided in reference links below. INCOIS will be able to use this for it’s fishermen feedback app, where fishermen need to take a photo of fishes caught and fish-identification will be done through code, minimizing the manual intervention.

																											Development of a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for Tropical Cyclone intensity estimation using half-hourly INSAT-3D IR Images and development of a web application for visualization of the imagery. INSAT3D/3DR observations are available at every 15-minute interval and these observations are very useful in understanding the instantaneous structural changes during evolution, intensification, and landfall of Tropical Cyclones. Datasets of Cyclones captured by INSAT-3D over the Indian Oceans are available since 2014. These datasets can be used for training and testing of the Model. Traditional methods for Intensity estimation require accurate center determination for intensity estimation. Development of CNN based model for intensity estimation will be very useful during the initial stage of cyclone formation when determination of accurate center becomes difficult.

																												Background: There are more than 1000 universities in India and these universities are offering thousands of undergraduate, post-Graduate and doctorate courses. The students applying for these universities have to do a lot of comparison for choosing the university/course on the basis of various criteria’s. A PAN India university information bank is required for accessing course details, comparison of courses, facilities and faculty, admission, tracking student mobility, viewing results, evaluation and certification, verification of certificates, joint online courses (MOOCs). This will help both student and faculty communities for self improvement through comparison and emulations. Lack of information is leading to self glorification and inbreeding among University and College student and faculty members. Summary: The universities in India provide various courses on different disciplines and the students have to compare these courses on the basis of various parameters. The courses range from Bachelor, Masters and P.hd courses. The integration of these details on a single platform will enhance the transparency and remove difficulty being faced by the students due to lack of information. Objective: : To develop an integrated platform to provide the information of the courses offered by Indian universities"

																														Background: Mining operations are generally spread over a vast area in remote locations and harsh environments. Coal extraction is a high cost and increasingly high technology venture that requires the utmost operational efficiency as well as uninterrupted workflow and delivery cycles. Operations cannot afford to be impacted due to lack of visibility as to the location and status of machinery, equipment and vehicles, since this causes delays, increased cost and mounting losses and is also an open invitation to theft and misuse. Real-time location tracking and monitoring, especially of moveable assets such as the vehicle fleet transporting the coal, is thus of critical importance to the mining industry. Tracking pickups and deliveries of thousands of truck-loads moving daily to and from various locations inside mining areas to processing plants, rail wagons or jetties is a logistics nightmare. Moving vehicle registration plate detection: RFID is fitted with vehicles moving across the mining region. The RFIDs are mapped to their respective registration number. It happens that two vehicles may exchange registration plates for malicious purpose including theft or forgery. A system is to be created to extract registration number from number plate of moving vehicle. The data captured should be transferred to cloud environment which can be available for further analysis of theft or proof reading. Summary: In general, most companies employ an active (battery-powered) radio frequency identification system to track trucks entering and leaving a mine with a load. This can be accomplished via a real-time location system (RTLS) if there are vehicles parked that need to be located quickly. But more commonly, an active RFID transponder is affixed to a vehicle, with readers set up at various points—at a mine’s entry gate, at a weigh station, at an exit and so forth. Software tracks the truck’s location, and you can usually run a variety of reports. The best solution really depends on the type of information that you would like to collect and use. Objective: To create an anti-theft auto security system that can extract registration number from number plate of moving vehicle. And can capture and transfer data to cloud, which can be available for further analysis of theft or proof reading."

																															"Background: Information sharing is a major factor for development in the country. It is a time taking process to share information to all the citizens of the country through media and newspaper. In this modern generation almost everyone has a mobile phone in their hand. We can use this opportunity to share information directly to them through SMS or email. This will save time and money and information can be shared with a larger community within short time duration.

																															"Every year huge number of students take admissions into college. With the current covid crisis ongoing, almost all the process have become online. Even classes have become online. It was observed that there were students who did fake enrollments while filling forms of a college for exams, online classes or similar purposes. Also online mischief was done by many students thus disturbing the whole class. Same happens with online exams happening with google forms. Since making fake Gmail id is not a big deal for kids of today’s generation hence often fake entries were found which caused lots of issues to teachers evaluating the answers. Hence we need to keep a Aadhar based authentication for students for filling up forms, giving examination or attending online classes. Addressing this problem will ensure only students authenticated with their Aadhar are only permitted to fill forms, attend online classes and give exams thus ensuring the tracking of students. Due to this only genuine entries will be there and any mischief done will be caught easily."
